# AI_ML_Project1
**Description**
In this Jupyter Notebook, I analyzed a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning repository. The dataset was collected by Amazon with the intention of determining whether, when offered a coupon for an establishment near a driver's location, a driver would accept or decline the coupon.

**Objective**
Amalysis is done with two different types of coupons: bar coupons and carry out & take away. In both cases, the goal was to understand what factors imoacted the driver's decision of accepting the coupon.

**Findings**
Bar Coupons

Passenger Type
Considering the inpact of passanger on accepting the bar coupon, it was noticed that if the driver has passanger as kids the acceptance rate is reduced as compared to having frnds as passanger or being alone

Marital Status
With regards to marital status, WIdowed driver/single drivers were most likely to accept the bar coupons.

Age
There wasn't a drastic difference between acceptance of different age groups, but the age group less than 30 is more likely to accept the bar coupons

Other Columns
Of the other columns we looked at, there wasn't as strong of a correlation between acceptance and either income or occupation.

**Carry out & take away**
Drivers accept the coupon for Carryout and take out
The acceptance rate is high for Carryaway and take out with the percentage being 73 %

Kids
Having Kids as passanger has no corelation and has only 6% of acceptance rate

Time of the day 
The gpagh represnts that the no of coupons sent and accepted are higher in the moring time.

Passanger
It is noticed that the accpetance rate is high with alone and travelling with frirnds at the same time the coupons issues are also high for these two criterias.

Driver Destination
Drivers who had no urgent destination or drivers heading towrds home accepted the coupon more often than drivers with a destination of going to work.
